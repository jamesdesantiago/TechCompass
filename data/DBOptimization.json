      "large": "Databases exceeding 1TB and tens of millions of rows or more. Large databases typically involve distributed systems, advanced indexing, and data warehousing techniques to handle the volume and velocity of data.",
      "very large": "Databases with hundreds of millions, billions of rows, or more. At this scale, traditional relational databases may not suffice, necessitating specialized data stores like NoSQL or time-series databases. Data warehousing becomes crucial for analytical workloads, enabling efficient querying on massive datasets. Employing big data technologies such as Hadoop or Spark is essential for processing data at this scale. Index management must be strategic, as excessive or poorly managed indexes can significantly impede write operations. This size category demands a comprehensive approach to data architecture to ensure performance and scalability."
